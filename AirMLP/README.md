## Welcome to the PM 2.5 Correction MLP Network Repository!

This repository houses a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) network designed to correct PM 2.5 data. The dataset used in this project is available for access via Zenodo at the following DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10037781.

For detailed insights into the dataset and the workings of the neural network, please refer to the research paper 
#### 'AirMLP: a multilayer perceptron neural network for temporal correction of PM2.5 values in Turin' 
##### authored by Casari M, Po L, and Zini L.

We invite you to explore our project, contribute to its development, and engage in discussions. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.
